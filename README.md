# Lab Graphic Generator
A program built for a research lab at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine to generate graphical visualizations of mouse colonies. It utilizes several python libraries, primarily pygame, pandas, and PIL. An excel file (template included) is used to numerically describe the colony. This file is then parsed via pandas and converted into a graphical representation involving a simple shape, ID, and color system. Additionally, an info file is produced to provide some simple metrics about the colony. Setup and installation is performed through several batch files. The github release does not include the executable file generated using pyinstaller. I do not claim rights to pygame, pyinstaller, or any other technologies or libraries used in this project.
